# Introduction and Library

This repository contains introductory model materials, such as tutorials or primers, and links to relevant literature, and to repositories of various results using BRICK.

## Library

To recommend new studies and results to add to this library, please either create an "Issue" using the button in the top horizontal menu bar here in the GitHub browser, or email Tony Wong (aewsma at rit.edu). At a minimum, we need:
* a stable URL link to the model output (projections of sea-level rise, temperature, etc.),
* a stable URL link to the model parameters used to generate that output, and
* a stable URL link to the published manuscript.
* The model code should be easily found from the Data/Code Availability section of the linked manuscript.
